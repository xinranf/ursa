## Getting Started

Ursa is built on top of Qualcomm’s Chat App Demo and inherits its Genie runtime, AI Hub integration, and QNN SDK usage. Below is a consolidated and updated setup guide combining Qualcomm’s instructions and our specific build process for Ursa.


## Current limitations on running Ursa

> Adapted from Qualcomm Chat App Demo documentation

This app **requires Android 15** and **does not run on all Android 14 consumer devices**. Genie SDK depends on recent meta-builds that may not be present on typical consumer devices. We recommend using a device from [Qualcomm QDC](https://qdc.qualcomm.com/) or a dev board that ships with updated system builds.

### Verified Device Configuration

| Device name | OS | Build Number |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ROG Phone 9 Pro | Android 15 | AQ3A.240829.003.35.1810.1810.326 |

## Requirements

### Hardware

- Snapdragon® Gen 3 or Snapdragon® 8 Elite
- Android 15 (strongly recommended)

### Tools and SDK

- Android Studio (version 2023.1.1 or newer)
- Access to the required model files and configs:
    [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1NxGWSq7-jmqbufWJBaY9LnsQNcMQu0Sp)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xinranf/ursa.git
cd ursa/apps/android/ChatApp
```
All following paths assume you are in the ChatApp directory.

### Step 2. Download Required Assets

Download the following files from the [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1NxGWSq7-jmqbufWJBaY9LnsQNcMQu0Sp):

#### Whisper Models

- Download `whisper-tiny.tflite` and `whisper-tiny-en.tflite`
- Place both in `src/main/assets/`


#### Llama 3.2-3B Model

- Download the three `.bin` files from `llama_3_2_3b` folder
- Place them into `src/main/assets/models/llama_3_2_3b`

**Resulting folder layout:**

```plaintext
src/main/assets/
├── htp_config/
├── models/
│   └── llama_3_2_3b/
│       ├── *.bin
│       ├── genie-config.json
│       └── tokenizer.json
├── whisper-tiny.tflite
└── whisper-tiny-en.tflite
```

### Step 3. Install QNN SDK
- Download [QNN SDK version 2.31.0.250130](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I24RvpuoQ_50di4RnlTl6R4sVPWRMwpI/view?usp=drive_link)
- Extract it locally
- Edit `ChatApp/build.gradle`:
```
def qnnSDKLocalPath = "[your/local/path/to/qnn/sdk]"
```
Example:
```
def qnnSDKLocalPath = "/opt/qcom/aistack/qairt/2.31.0.250130"
```

### Step 4. Update Build Configuration

In `apps/android/build.gradle`:
```
plugins {
id 'com.android.application' version '8.6.1'
}
```
Then in Android Studio:

- Go to **File → Project Structure**
- Set **Gradle version** to `8.9`


## Building the APK

1. Open the **`apps/android/`** folder (not `ChatApp`) in Android Studio
2. Run **Gradle Sync**
3. Build `ChatApp` target:
   - **Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)**
4. Run 'ChatApp'

## Running on Device

After installing the APK on your Android 15 device, ensure the app has the necessary runtime permissions to function correctly.

### Grant Microphone Permission

Navigate to `Settings → Apps & Notifications → Ursa → Permissions → Microphone`

Then select `Allow only while using the app`

This is required for the voice control feature to work. Without microphone access, the app will not activate voice input or transcription.
